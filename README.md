Netflix Engagement Churn Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard Insights
The Netflix Engagement Churn Analysis project is designed to analyze customer engagement and churn behavior using a dataset (sourced from Kaggle). This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of various metrics such as engagement rate, customer satisfaction, churn rate, payment history, and daily watch time across different devices.

1. Overview of the Dashboard Components
The dashboard consists of multiple visual elements, each contributing to the overall analysis of churn behavior:

A. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Engagement Rate: 6.95 â€“ Represents the level of customer engagement with Netflix.
Total Customers Analyzed: 3,500 â€“ The dataset includes 3,500 customer records.
Customer Satisfaction Score: 6.93 â€“ The average satisfaction score among Netflix users.
B. Age Distribution Filter
The age filter allows users to analyze churn and engagement trends across different age groups.
This provides insights into which age groups are more likely to churn and how engagement differs by age.
C. Payment History (On-Time vs. Delayed)
77.97% (2.73K) of users pay on time, while 22.03% (0.77K) have delayed payments.
Delayed payments may correlate with a higher churn rate, as customers who struggle with timely payments may be less engaged.
D. Churn Rate Analysis
11.34% of customers have churned (0.4K), while 88.66% remain active (3.1K).
Understanding what causes customers to churn is essential for improving engagement and retention strategies.
E. Daily Watch Time by Device Used
Users watch Netflix on four primary devices:
Laptop: 3.08K hours (25.07%)
Mobile: 3.13K hours (25.49%)
Smart TV: 3.1K hours (25.23%)
Tablet: 2.97K hours (24.21%)
The usage is fairly evenly distributed, but trends in device preference may impact churn rates.

2. How the Dashboard Works
A. Interactivity
The Power BI dashboard allows interactive filtering, where users can select:
Age groups to see how churn varies by demographics.
Payment history categories to explore its effect on retention.
Device type filters to understand engagement behavior across different platforms.
B. Data Relationships & Analysis
Engagement & Churn Relationship

A high engagement rate (6.95) suggests that most customers actively use Netflix.
Despite good engagement, 11.34% churned, which requires further investigation.
Impact of Payment History on Churn

Delayed payments are more common among churned users.
Customers who pay late might be more likely to cancel or abandon their subscriptions.
Device Usage Trends

Users watching on mobile and smart TVs have slightly higher watch times.
If a specific device group has a higher churn rate, Netflix can target engagement efforts accordingly.

3. Findings & Conclusions
A. Factors Influencing Churn
Low Customer Satisfaction (6.93)

Although engagement is decent, a satisfaction score of 6.93 is not high.
Netflix may need to improve content recommendations, streaming quality, or pricing strategies.
Delayed Payments & Churn

22% of users have delayed payments, and these customers may be more likely to churn.
Offering flexible payment options or reminders may reduce churn in this segment.
Age & Churn Trends

By filtering age groups, Netflix can identify whether younger or older customers churn more.
Targeted content or pricing adjustments could help retain specific age groups.
Device Preference & Engagement

Mobile & Smart TV users have the highest engagement.
If any device type correlates with higher churn, Netflix may need to optimize the viewing experience for that platform.

4. Recommendations to Reduce Churn
Personalized Content Recommendations: Improve algorithm-driven recommendations to keep users engaged.
Payment Flexibility: Introduce grace periods or loyalty discounts for late payers.
Device Optimization: Ensure smooth streaming across all device types.
Improve Customer Experience: Enhance UI/UX, customer support, and content library.
